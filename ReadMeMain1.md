A Buffer in Node.js is a global object used to handle binary data directly in memory. It's designed to work with raw binary data, which is not suitable for standard JavaScript strings due to the latter's handling of character encodings like UTF-8 or UTF-16.

Buffers are particularly useful when dealing with streams of data from files, network transmissions, or other I/O operations where handling binary data is necessary. They are also frequently used when dealing with encoding and decoding of data formats, such as base64.

Key Characteristics of Buffers
Fixed-Size Allocation: Buffers are allocated a specific amount of memory and cannot be resized. This ensures efficient handling of data and avoids the overhead of dynamic resizing.
Binary Data Handling: Buffers allow manipulation of raw binary data directly, enabling operations like reading and writing bytes, slicing data, and more.
Common Uses of Buffers
Reading and Writing Files: When interacting with file systems, buffers are used to read and write binary data.
Networking: Buffers handle binary data streams in network communications, such as TCP/UDP protocols.
Encoding/Decoding: Buffers are used to encode and decode data in different formats (e.g., base64, hex).
Example of Using Buffers
In the provided basicAuthorizer function, a buffer is used to decode base64-encoded credentials. Here’s a brief explanation of how it works:

Base64-Encoded String: The credentials are initially encoded in base64 format.
Buffer Creation: The Buffer.from method creates a buffer from the base64 string.
Decoding: The buffer is then decoded into a UTF-8 string, which contains the original email and password.
Example Code
Here’s an example demonstrating basic Buffer operations:
const str = 'Hello, World!';
const buf = Buffer.from(str, 'utf8'); // Create a buffer from a string

console.log(buf); // <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21>

const base64Str = buf.toString('base64'); // Encode buffer to base64
console.log(base64Str); // SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==

const decodedBuf = Buffer.from(base64Str, 'base64'); // Decode base64 back to buffer
const decodedStr = decodedBuf.toString('utf8'); // Convert buffer to UTF-8 string
console.log(decodedStr); // Hello, World!

Application in basicAuthorizer
In the basicAuthorizer function:

Extract Base64 Credentials: The base64-encoded credentials are extracted from the authorization header.
Decode with Buffer: Buffer.from(base64Credentials, 'base64').toString('utf8') is used to decode these credentials into a readable string format.
Split Credentials: The decoded string is split into email and password components for authentication.
This method ensures secure and efficient handling of binary data for authentication purposes.
