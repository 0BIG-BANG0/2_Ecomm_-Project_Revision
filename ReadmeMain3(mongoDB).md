# MongoDB Connection Module

This module provides a way to connect to a MongoDB database using Node.js and the MongoDB official driver.

## Features
- Connect to a MongoDB database using the `MongoClient` from the MongoDB Node.js driver.
- Provides a method to retrieve the database instance for further operations.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Importing the `MongoClient` from the `mongodb` package
```javascript
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
```
- **`MongoClient`** is an object provided by the MongoDB Node.js driver to interact with MongoDB databases.
- **Why we use it?** 
  - It provides the methods necessary to connect to a MongoDB instance, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and interact with collections and databases.

### 2. Database Connection URL
```javascript
const url = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ecomdb";
```
- **`url`** is the connection string for MongoDB. It contains:
  - **`mongodb://`**: This specifies the protocol to use to connect to the database (MongoDB).
  - **`127.0.0.1`**: This is the local loopback address (localhost), which means the MongoDB server is running locally.
  - **`27017`**: This is the default port where MongoDB listens for connections.
  - **`ecomdb`**: This is the database name you're trying to connect to.

### 3. Declaring the `client` variable
```javascript
let client;
```
- **`client`** is declared as a `let` variable outside any function. It will store the connection instance once the MongoDB connection is established.

### 4. Defining the `connectToMongoDB` function
```javascript
export const connectToMongoDB = () => {
  MongoClient.connect(url)
    .then((clientInstance) => {
        client = clientInstance;
      console.log("MongoDb is connected");
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log(err);
    });
};
```
- **`export const connectToMongoDB = () => {...}`**: 
  - This is an **arrow function** exported as a module. It allows this function to be used in other parts of the application when the module is imported.
  
- **`MongoClient.connect(url)`**:
  - This method is responsible for connecting to the MongoDB instance at the provided URL.
  - It returns a **promise**, which resolves with a MongoClient instance when the connection is successful.

- **`.then((clientInstance) => {...})`**:
  - The `.then()` method handles the successful connection to MongoDB. It receives `clientInstance`, which is the MongoClient object representing the connection to the database.
  - **`client = clientInstance`**: Once connected, the `clientInstance` is stored in the `client` variable.

- **`.catch((err) => {...})`**:
  - The `.catch()` method is used to handle any errors that occur during the connection attempt.

### 5. Defining the `getDB` function
```javascript
export const getDB = () => {
  return client.db();
};
```
- **`export const getDB = () => {...}`**: 
  - This is another arrow function exported as a module. It returns the current MongoDB database instance.
- **`client.db()`**:
  - This method is called on the MongoClient object (`client`). It provides access to the database you are connected to.

## Usage
1. Call `connectToMongoDB()` to connect to MongoDB.
2. Once connected, use `getDB()` to retrieve the database instance for performing operations.
